  text: 'We took a number of tours on our recent cruise and Artemis was the best guide! She gave excellent descriptions of things we saw… not too detailed (we didn’t want a history class!) and not touristy. Climbing the Acropolis wasn’t as daunting as it looked for the two of us out-of-shape seniors and Artemis was encouraging all the way. She gave us some free time to wander the Acropolis but guided us through the museum with a lot of commentary. A perfect combination.'
